# To-Do List Application (WIP)

A simple To-Do / task-management application — currently under development.  
Built with SQLite + FLTK for a lightweight GUI, aiming to be a minimal desktop-based task tracker.

## 🔧 What It Does (Planned)  
- Add, edit, delete tasks  
- Mark tasks as done / undone  
- Persist tasks in a local SQLite database  
- Intuitive GUI for easy task management  
- Lightweight and easy to use  

## ⚙️ Built With / Tech Stack  
- SQLite — for local data persistence  
- FLTK — for GUI (cross-platform)  

## 🚧 Status: Work In Progress  
- Core database logic:                          ✔️ (tasks stored/fetched)  
- Basic GUI build:                              🔄 / in progress  
- Task-add/edit/delete interface:               🔄 in progress  
- Task filtering, sorting, due-date reminders:  🔄 planned  

## 🛠 How to Use / Run (when ready)  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpaceSHEEEEP/To-Do-List.git
2. Build (or run) using the appropriate build instructions (TBD)
3. Launch the GUI; tasks will be saved locally in a SQLite database file
